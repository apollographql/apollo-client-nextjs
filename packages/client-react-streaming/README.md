# `@apollo/client-react-streaming`

This package provides building blocks to create framework-level integration of Apollo Client with React's streaming SSR. See the [@apollo/client-integration-nextjs](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-nextjs/tree/main/packages/experimental-nextjs-app-support) package as an example.

It can also be used to use Apollo Client with a custom streaming SSR setup, e.g. with Vite. See the [vite streaming integration test](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-nextjs/tree/main/integration-test/vite-streaming) as an example.
