   * the application, setting this to `true` might be okay with React 19, which is much better at recovering
   * from hydration mismatches - but it still comes with a risk.
   * When enabling this, you should closely monitor error reporting and user feedback.

/**
 * > This export is only available in React Client Components
 *
 * Creates a "manual" Data Transport, to be used with `WrapApolloProvider`.
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * ### Drawbacks
 *
 * While this Data Transport enables streaming SSR, it has some conceptual drawbacks:
 *
 * - It does not have a way of keeping your connection open if your application already finished, but there are still ongoing queries that might need to be transported over.
 *   - This can happen if a component renders `useBackgroundQuery`, but does not read the `queryRef` with `useReadQuery`
 *   - These "cut off" queries will be restarted in the browser once the browser's `load` event happens
 * - If the `useInsertHtml` doesn't immediately flush data to the browser, the browser might already attain "newer" data through queries triggered by user interaction.
 *   - This delayed behaviour is the case with the Next.js `ServerInsertedHTMLContext` and in the example Vite implementation.
 *   - In this, case, older data from the server might overwrite newer data in the browser. This is minimized by simulating ongoing queries in the browser once the information of a started query is transported over.
 *     If the browser would try to trigger the exact same query, query deduplication would make the browser wait for the server query to resolve instead.
 * - For more timing-related details, see https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-integrations/pull/9
 *
 * To fully work around these drawbacks, React needs to add "data injection into the stream" to it's public API, which is not the case today.
 * We provide an [example with a patched React version](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-integrations/blob/main/integration-test/experimental-react) to showcase how that could look.
 *
 * @example
 * For usage examples, see the implementation of the `@apollo/client-integration-nextjs`
 * [`ApolloNextAppProvider`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-integrations/blob/c0715a05cf8ca29a3cbb9ce294cdcbc5ce251b2e/packages/experimental-nextjs-app-support/src/ApolloNextAppProvider.ts)
 *
 * ```tsx
 * export const ApolloNextAppProvider = WrapApolloProvider(
 *   buildManualDataTransport({
 *     useInsertHtml() {
 *       const insertHtml = useContext(ServerInsertedHTMLContext);
 *       if (!insertHtml) {
 *         throw new Error(
 *           "ApolloNextAppProvider cannot be used outside of the Next App Router!"
 *         );
 *       }
 *       return insertHtml;
 *     },
 *   })
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * Another usage example is our integration example with Vite and streaming SSR, which you can find at https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-integrations/tree/main/integration-test/vite-streaming
